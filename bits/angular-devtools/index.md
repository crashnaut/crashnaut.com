# Angular DevTools

The [Angular DevTools](https://angular.dev/tools/devtools) is a browser extension that provides **debugging** and **profiling** capabilities for Angular applications.
With the DevTools you can explore the component tree and investigate (and edit) the state of your components.

Using the profiler you can visualize the execution of Angularâ€™s change detection and use this to identify performance bottlenecks.

This feature makes it easy to compare the different change detection strategies.
The benefits of local change detection, which [Rainer Hahnekamp](https://twitter.com/rainerhahnekamp/) explains in his blog [Local Change Detection in Angular](https://medium.com/ngconf/local-change-detection-in-angular-410d82b38664), will clearly be visible in the profiler.
